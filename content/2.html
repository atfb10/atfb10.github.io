<h1> Doing Hard Things </h1><br />
    Doing hard things is a difficult but rewarding experience. It often requires us to push ourselves to the limits of our capabilities, face our greatest fears, and work hard for something that we may not even necessarily know what the outcome is going to be. But, that is what makes it so exciting!<br />
<br />
When we do hard things, we often find out what we’re capable of, and what we can achieve. We find the strength and courage to overcome our fears and achieve our goals. It’s a beautiful thing when we can look back and reflect on the hard work and dedication that we put into doing something that we thought we couldn’t do.<br />
<br />
We also learn a lot about ourselves when we do hard things. We find out what we’re passionate about, what our strengths and weaknesses are, and how our minds work when faced with difficult challenges. Doing hard things can also give us a sense of accomplishment and pride, as we realize that we can do more than we thought we were capable of.<br />
<br />
Finally, doing hard things can open us up to a world of possibilities. It can lead us to unexpected places, and can help us find our true passions in life. It can motivate us to keep trying and never give up. It can even help us find our purpose and our calling in life. <br />
<br />
So, take the plunge and do something hard today. You never know what you may discover or what impact it will have on your life. Doing hard things is worth the effort, and it’s always rewarding in the end.</body>
